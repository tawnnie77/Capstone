## Welcome to My Professional ePortfolio

# Introduction

### My name is Tanya Noyes. I am a student at Southern New Hampshire University, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. In my Professional Self-Assessment, I offer a comprehensive introduction about myself. Furthermore, I have included various projects I created while at SNHU, which I will now showcase through more advanced and professionally applicable applications developed during my Computer Science Capstone course.

# Personal Self-Assessment

### My journey through the Computer Science program was both challenging and fulfilling. The coursework demanded significant dedication, often resulting in sleepless nights. There were times when I felt completely lost, struggling to grasp coding concepts and problem-solving techniques. Without anyone in my immediate circle to guide me, frustration sometimes led to tears. However, resilience is part of my nature, and I embraced the challenges, determined to persevere and succeed.
### As I neared the completion of my studies, I realized that my learning journey was far from over. I approached each task with a strategic mindset, aiming to consistently refine my skills in coding. Initially, I started with Python, which felt accessible, but transitioning to C++ was a bit confusing.

### In my CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course, I gained insights into the various stages of software development from both developer and tester perspectives. This experience emphasized the significance of effective communication and documentation throughout the process. I found this course particularly engaging due to my analytical mindset. By completing a Software Requirement Specification document, I ensured alignment among team members and prioritized clear communication. 

### My portfolio includes artifacts from my courses, showcasing my skills in Software Design and database management, reflecting my dedication to continuous improvement and readiness to face future software challenges.

### Here is a direct link to my YouTube channel, where I have uploaded a detailed Code Review video. In this presentation, I cover several important aspects:

### -Existing Functionality: I provide a comprehensive walkthrough of the code, clarifying its purpose, the specific tasks it performs, and the underlying mechanics that drive its operation.
### -Code Analysis: I analyze the structure of the code, searching for areas where efficiencies can be improved. Additionally, I evaluate the presence of comments and documentation, sharing my insights on how well these elements support understanding and maintainability.
### -Enhancements: I discuss potential improvements, offering an explanation of planned enhancements and how they could elevate the overall functionality of the code.

### The initial artifact I present serves as an evaluation and enhancement of a project from CS 320, completed in May 2024, which highlights my competencies in Software Engineering and Design. In this process, I meticulously examined the existing code to identify areas that required improvement and documented the modifications made in alignment with the course objectives. My approach focused on improving code quality through modular design, which not only simplifies maintenance and scalability but also strengthens input validation to ensure the software's reliability and efficiency. By segmenting the code into smaller, manageable functions, I showcased my proficiency in creating maintainable systems that follow object-oriented design principles, especially the Single Responsibility Principle.

### Additionally, I sustained the software's resilience by implementing thorough input validation and effective exception handling. I also transitioned from using an ArrayList to a HashMap, which significantly optimized the contact retrieval process. This change exemplifies my ability to choose suitable data structures that enhance performance while meeting course expectations. Overall, the modifications I made reflect my commitment to delivering high-quality software solutions that align with best practices in software design and engineering.

# Algorithms and Data Structures

### The second artifact I present illustrates the significant advancements I made to a project from the CS 320 course, completed in May 2024. This project focused on developing a contact management system that was optimized for more efficient detail modifications. In my efforts to improve efficiency, I replaced the ArrayList with a HashMap, a change that dramatically reduced the time required for critical operations, particularly updates that had formerly relied on linear searches. By utilizing contact IDs in the HashMap, I was able to enhance the search functionality, which in turn elevated the overall performance of the system. 

### In addition to these structural changes, I concentrated on modifying only the essential fields, which further optimized operational efficiency. The goal of these enhancements was to create a more effective system that delivers a quicker user experience when managing contacts. I believe these upgrades meet all the project requirements, demonstrating my capability to select the right data structures and algorithms. This ultimately leads to improved system performance and underscores my commitment to software excellence.

### The third artifact I present is an improved version of a project from the CS 340 course, which was finalized in October 2024. This project focuses on creating a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application specifically designed for managing data within an animal shelter, employing MongoDB as the core database solution. The application simplifies critical operations such as adding new animals and deleting records, thereby enhancing the overall management of information. This improvement not only aids in animal care but also optimizes the operational efficiency of the shelter. I chose to showcase this project due to the challenges it presented, which led to a reevaluation of its functionalities.

### Despite the initial system's effectiveness, I identified areas where database features and data retrieval methods could be enhanced. My strategy involves MongoDB's advanced functionalities, including aggregation pipelines for executing complex queries and implementing a robust user authentication system for secure access to sensitive information. Additionally, I am developing a web interface using HTML and JavaScript to facilitate better user engagement. These enhancements aim to create a more efficient database system that aligns with the specific requirements of the shelter. I am confident that I have fulfilled the essential objectives of the course, particularly in strengthening User Authentication and Role-Based Access Control, which regulates access to sensitive data and CRUD functionalities based on user roles. Furthermore, the Frontend Integration includes a user-friendly interface that allows seamless database interaction through web browsers, thereby enhancing the user experience while ensuring high security standards are upheld.
