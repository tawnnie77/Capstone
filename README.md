## Welcome to My Professional ePortfolio

# Introduction

### My name is Tanya Noyes. I am a student at Southern New Hampshire University, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. In my Professional Self-Assessment, I offer a comprehensive introduction about myself. Furthermore, I have included various projects I created while at SNHU, which I will now showcase through more advanced and professionally applicable applications developed during my Computer Science Capstone course.

# Personal Self-Assessment

### My journey through the Computer Science program was both challenging and fulfilling. The coursework demanded significant dedication, often resulting in sleepless nights. There were times when I felt completely lost, struggling to grasp coding concepts and problem-solving techniques. Without anyone in my immediate circle to guide me, frustration sometimes led to tears. However, resilience is part of my nature, and I embraced the challenges, determined to persevere and succeed.
### As I neared the completion of my studies, I realized that my learning journey was far from over. I approached each task with a strategic mindset, aiming to consistently refine my skills in coding. Initially, I started with Python, which felt accessible, but transitioning to C++ was a bit confusing.

### In my CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course, I gained insights into the various stages of software development from both developer and tester perspectives. This experience emphasized the significance of effective communication and documentation throughout the process. I found this course particularly engaging due to my analytical mindset. By completing a Software Requirement Specification document, I ensured alignment among team members and prioritized clear communication. 

### My portfolio includes artifacts from my courses, showcasing my skills in Software Design and database management, reflecting my dedication to continuous improvement and readiness to face future software challenges.

### Here is a direct link to my YouTube channel, where I have uploaded a detailed Code Review video. In this presentation, I cover several important aspects:

### -Existing Functionality: I provide a comprehensive walkthrough of the code, clarifying its purpose, the specific tasks it performs, and the underlying mechanics that drive its operation.
### -Code Analysis: I analyze the structure of the code, searching for areas where efficiencies can be improved. Additionally, I evaluate the presence of comments and documentation, sharing my insights on how well these elements support understanding and maintainability.
### -Enhancements: I discuss potential improvements, offering an explanation of planned enhancements and how they could elevate the overall functionality of the code.

### This document assesses and builds upon a project from CS 320 completed in May 2024, demonstrating my skills in Software Engineering and Design. I analyzed the previous code to identify areas for improvement and outline the modifications made to align with course objectives. My approach focused on improving code quality through modularity for easier maintenance and scalability, emphasizing strong input validation for reliability and efficiency. By restructuring code into smaller functions, I illustrate my proficiency in creating maintainable systems that follow object-oriented design principles, such as the Single Responsibility Principle. Additionally, I enhanced software resilience with thorough input validation and effective exception handling, and I transitioned from an ArrayList to a HashMap to optimize contact retrieval, reflecting my capacity to select suitable data structures to improve performance in line with course goals.
