## Welcome to My Professional ePortfolio

# Introduction

### My name is Tanya Noyes. I am a student at Southern New Hampshire University, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. In my Professional Self-Assessment, I offer a comprehensive introduction about myself. Furthermore, I have included various projects I created while at SNHU, which I will now showcase through more advanced and professionally applicable applications developed during my Computer Science Capstone course.

# Personal Self-Assessment

### My journey through the Computer Science program was both challenging and fulfilling. The coursework demanded significant dedication, often resulting in sleepless nights. There were times when I felt completely lost, struggling to grasp coding concepts and problem-solving techniques. Without anyone in my immediate circle to guide me, frustration sometimes led to tears. However, resilience is part of my nature, and I embraced the challenges, determined to persevere and succeed.
### As I neared the completion of my studies, I realized that my learning journey was far from over. I approached each task with a strategic mindset, aiming to consistently refine my skills in coding. Initially, I started with Python, which felt accessible, but transitioning to C++ was a bit confusing.

### In my CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course, I gained insights into the various stages of software development from both developer and tester perspectives. This experience emphasized the significance of effective communication and documentation throughout the process. I found this course particularly engaging due to my analytical mindset. By completing a Software Requirement Specification document, I ensured alignment among team members and prioritized clear communication. 

### My portfolio includes artifacts from my courses, showcasing my skills in Software Design and database management, reflecting my dedication to continuous improvement and readiness to face future software challenges.

### Here is a direct link to my YouTube channel, where I have uploaded a detailed Code Review video. In this presentation, I cover several important aspects:

###-Existing Functionality: I provide a comprehensive walkthrough of the code, clarifying its purpose, the specific tasks it performs, and the underlying mechanics that drive its operation.
###-Code Analysis: I analyze the structure of the code, searching for areas where efficiencies can be improved. Additionally, I evaluate the presence of comments and documentation, sharing my insights on how well these elements support understanding and maintainability.
###-Enhancements: I discuss potential improvements, offering an explanation of planned enhancements and how they could elevate the overall functionality of the code.
